Bartok_10536_10720,dev,3.0,2.5,3.0,"Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears."
Bartok_10721_10876,dev,2.9,3.1,3.1,The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over.
Bartok_12191_12286,dev,2.86,3.0,3.43,"As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation."
Bartok_13098_13136,dev,3.0,2.8,3.0,Example 11 illustrates this structure.
Bartok_14045_14140,dev,3.0,3.11,3.33,Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.
Bartok_15325_15493,dev,3.0,3.1,3.2,"This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge."
Bartok_18354_18624,dev,3.0,2.8,3.2,"While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive."
Bartok_18852_18996,dev,3.0,2.88,2.88,"This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section."
Bartok_20798_21023,dev,3.0,2.89,3.11,"The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center)."
Bartok_21701_21944,dev,3.0,2.88,3.0,"Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section."
Bartok_23627_24007,dev,3.0,3.0,3.0,"In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation."
Bartok_3174_3210,dev,3.0,2.88,3.0,"To begin with, the movement is in F."
Bartok_3950_4223,dev,3.29,2.86,3.14,"Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg."
Bartok_4224_4413,dev,3.0,2.56,3.0,"The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition."
Bartok_5132_5240,dev,3.0,2.75,3.0,Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure.
Bartok_6460_6654,dev,3.12,2.88,3.12,"The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive."
Black_and_white_10174_10292,dev,3.13,2.75,3.25,For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces.
Black_and_white_13642_13858,dev,3.0,2.9,2.7,"Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low."
Black_and_white_13858_14101,dev,2.9,2.8,3.0,"“In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray”"
Black_and_white_14143_14359,dev,3.0,2.86,3.14,Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness.
Black_and_white_17324_17418,dev,3.25,2.75,2.75,It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas.
Black_and_white_381_543,dev,2.9,3.1,3.0,"At the same time in our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space."
Black_and_white_4340_4441,dev,3.1,2.9,3.1,colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place.
Black_and_white_543_683,dev,2.56,3.0,3.11,"color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch."
Black_and_white_5715_5883,dev,2.8,3.0,3.1,"color rests on the surface of an object, it is superficial, cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing."
Black_and_white_6393_6693,dev,3.14,3.29,3.14,"For [Charles Blanc] color also represents a kind of ruination. color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself – but back into which it could always slide"
Black_and_white_6717_6897,dev,3.4,2.9,2.9,"It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself."
Black_and_white_6898_6942,dev,3.0,2.7,3.0,"Thus, began the cult of the black and white."
Black_and_white_9707_9798,dev,3.0,3.1,3.2,The use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space.
