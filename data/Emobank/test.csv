Bartok_13452_13591,test,3.0,2.88,3.0,"Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth."

Bartok_15999_16176,test,3.0,2.6,3.2,"Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged."

Bartok_18730_18809,test,2.9,2.6,2.8,The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭).
Bartok_18997_19170,test,3.0,3.11,3.33,"Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303."
Bartok_20117_20365,test,3.0,3.12,3.25,"The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17."
Bartok_23488_23626,test,2.91,2.82,3.18,"In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody."
Bartok_2666_2761,test,3.0,2.75,3.0,"The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively."
Bartok_2957_3173,test,3.1,2.8,3.0,"While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure."
Bartok_4414_4598,test,2.9,2.9,3.1,"Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet."
Bartok_5742_6025,test,3.0,3.0,3.0,"The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece."
Bartok_6177_6348,test,3.0,2.9,3.1,"The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale."
Bartok_7330_7450,test,2.9,2.9,2.9,Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.
Bartok_7469_7600,test,3.0,3.0,3.1,If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.

alumnifund1_462_479,test,3.12,3.0,3.0,Dear Ms. LastName
anth_essay_4_11260_11357,test,3.0,3.0,3.0,This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.
anth_essay_4_132_239,test,3.1,2.9,2.9,Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity
anth_essay_4_15818_16017,test,3.0,2.78,3.22,"In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new."
anth_essay_4_16916_17130,test,2.7,3.1,2.8,"The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85)."
anth_essay_4_1705_1964,test,3.0,3.1,3.0,"Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages."
anth_essay_4_17428_17710,test,3.0,2.88,3.12,The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.
anth_essay_4_18008_18264,test,3.0,3.0,3.12,"An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67)."
anth_essay_4_252_389,test,2.89,3.22,3.22,"Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others."
anth_essay_4_2541_2819,test,2.8,2.9,3.1,"In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers."
anth_essay_4_6071_6152,test,2.91,2.73,3.18,It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .
anth_essay_4_6385_6632,test,2.86,3.0,3.0,"A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society."
anth_essay_4_8985_9168,test,3.5,3.25,3.25,"While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities."
anth_essay_4_9891_10154,test,3.27,2.64,3.27,Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).
